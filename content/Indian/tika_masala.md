## The day of cooking!

###### Preprep: chop up your onions, and if you have fresh garlic, ginger etc.

###### 1st. Add some oil in the pan, and cook the chicken on medium heat, but not enitrely through! just so it gets a nice color, once it's almost done, set it aside. ! DO NOT CLEAN THE PAN ! 

###### 2nd. Add some more oil, and add the onions to cook them down, once done you can add your garlic and ginger if you have fresh ones.

###### 3rd. Add the Tomato sauce and cook it down aswell, 2-3 minutes should do the trick. season this with! 0.5 Tsp Tumeric, 1-2 Tsp Koriander powder, 1 Tsp Cumin Powder and 0.5 - 2 Tsp Chiili powder.

###### 4th. now that the sauce cooked down and the spices unfolded, add the chicken, mix well and add around 600-900ml of water. let it cook for 10 minutes (add a Tbsp of Garam Masala)

###### 5th. and finally, sprinkle some sugar in, a pinch is enough. then add the heavy cream. stir it around until it becomes nice and orange, time to taste!
