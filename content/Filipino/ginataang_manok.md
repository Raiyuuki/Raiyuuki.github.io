Get some Nice fatty Coconut milk, i'd say around 40% upwards. This dish, as well as many other versions have alot of freedom! as long as the core ingridients are correct"

If you crave this dish. and you dont have much at home, replace the fresh Garlic and Ginger with powder. and the Chicken Wings with Chicken Breast, but you neeeeed to add chicken powder.

if you leave the Veg out, thats fine too, just cook the chicken a bit longer, 35-40 mins are fine. (thats how i like it most lmao)
