      <description>Foreword&#xD;This is the Recipe i use to make Ginataang Manok, also called a Chicken Coconut Stew.&#xA;Tip&#xD;Get some Nice fatty Coconut milk, i’d say around 40% upwards. This dish, as well as many other versions have alot of freedom! as long as the core ingridients are correct&#34;&#xA;Shopping list! Chicken Wings Coconut milk Onions, Potatos, Carrots (the veg) Garlic, Ginger and Vinegar (flavouring) A hearty Stew preprep: chop the veg roughly, the potatos and carrots rather big while the rest is roughly copped. 1st. add some oil and fry the onions, garlic and the ginger off, medium - high is good, until you can smell them. Tip&#xD;i highly recommend to add Shrimp Paste. it just gives it so much more Umami</description>
