      <description>Foreword&#xD;This is the Recipe i use to make Ginataang Manok, also called a Chicken Coconut Stew. As always, keep in mind i go alot by feeling! adjust it to your liking. The list of spices used will be at the very end if you dont have them at home!&#xA;Tip&#xD;Get some Nice fatty Coconut milk, i’d say around 40% upwards. This dish, as well as many other versions have alot of freedom! as long as the core ingridients are correct&#34;</description>
