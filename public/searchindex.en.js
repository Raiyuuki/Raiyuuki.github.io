Name of the Item Amount Chicken Wings 500g Coconut milk 1 can Onions, Potatos, Carrots, Garlic, Ginger and Vinegar — Fish sauce — A hearty Stew preprep: chop the veg roughly, the potatos and carrots rather big while the rest is roughly copped. 1st. add some oil and fry the onions, garlic and the ginger off, medium - high is good, until you can smell them.

And thats it really! serve on rice and its done! Note\rIf you crave this dish. and you dont have much at home, replace the fresh Garlic and Ginger with powder. and the Chicken Wings with Chicken Breast, but you neeeeed to add chicken powder.\nNote\rif you leave the Veg out, thats fine too, just cook the chicken a bit longer, 35-40 mins are fine. (thats how i like it most lmao)",
