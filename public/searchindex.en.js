This dish, as well as many other versions have alot of freedom! as long as the core ingridients are correct\"\nShopping list! Chicken Wings Coconut milk Onions, Potatos, Carrots (the veg) Garlic, Ginger and Vinegar (flavouring) A hearty Stew preprep: chop the veg roughly, the potatos and carrots rather big while the rest is roughly copped. 1st. add some oil and fry the onions, garlic and the ginger off, medium - high is good, until you can smell them. Tip\ri highly recommend to add Shrimp Paste. it just gives it so much more Umami\n2nd. add the chicken wings. (skin side down) and cook them for 5-7 mins, flip them half way. Season with Salt and Pepper of course! 3rd. time for the coconut milk, add it and scrape the bottom of the pot. then add a bit of fish sauce. 4th. bring to a boil then reduce the heat, let it cook for 25-30 mins 5th. add the Potatos and Carrots and let it cook for another 5ish minutes, until the veg are to your liking. 6th. add some Vinegar and taste it. if you feel like something is missing, salt, garlic powder, etc are your friend! And thats it really! serve on rice and its done! Note\rIf you crave this dish. and you dont have much at home, replace the fresh Garlic and Ginger with powder. and the Chicken Wings with Chicken Breast, but you neeeeed to add chicken powder.\nNote\rif you leave the Veg out, thats fine too, just cook the chicken a bit longer, 35-40 mins are fine. (thats how i like it most lmao)",
